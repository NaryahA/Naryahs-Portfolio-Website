# Naryah Portfolio Website 

# Description
Welcome to my Portfolio website! This site is a showcase of my skills, projects, and personal achievements in web development. It provides an overview of my work, allowing potential employers, collaborators, and visitors to learn more about the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, the technologies I use, and my approach to problem-solving.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
